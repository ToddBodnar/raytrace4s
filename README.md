## About
A side project based on [Peter Shirley's raytracing series](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8), it was built for educational purposes and doesn't contain many optimizations.

For sample renders from various steps along development, see the `./renders/` directory.


## Usage
Run `Main.scala` in the `raytrace4s` package to generate images, or toy around with the `shapes` list in main to config your own.
