## Todos/Roadmap

Some general ideas of how this can be extended, in rough order of what I'd like to work on:

- [x] Clean up `Main`
- [ ] Bounding box / grouping support (needed for `.3ds` to be easy)
- [ ] `.3ds` support (teapot render?)
- [ ] Rectangle / Cube (just based on a group of triangles)
- [ ] [NURBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline)
- [ ] Clean up docs / some stuff on theory
